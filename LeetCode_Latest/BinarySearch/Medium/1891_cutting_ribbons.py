        # This is a binary search problem
        # Key - rather searching for the maximum possible ribbon length x such that you can cut at least k ribbons of length x.
        # You're trying to maximize x, the length of each ribbon piece.

        # For a given candidate length x, check:
            # Can we cut at least k ribbons of length x from the input?

        # This check is monotonic:
        # If x is possible, then all values smaller than x are also possible.
        # If x is not possible, then all values larger than x are also impossible.

        # Time - O(n Ã— log(max)) where n = len(ribbons) and max = max(ribbons)
        # Space - O(1)
