        # Time Complexity:
        # Valid digit pairs:
        # ('0', '0'), ('1', '1'), ('6', '9'), ('8', '8'), ('9', '6') â†’ 5 options
        # Each recursive step builds numbers of length k from numbers of length k - 2 by inserting one of the 5 pairs on both ends.

        # Core Insight:
        # At each recursive level (moving outward), we have up to 5 choices to wrap around each of the shorter strings.
