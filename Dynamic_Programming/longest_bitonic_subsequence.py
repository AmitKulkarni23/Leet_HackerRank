# Given an array arr[0 â€¦ n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of arr[] is
# called Bitonic if it is first increasing,
# then decreasing.
# Write a function that takes an array as argument
# and returns the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.
# A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with
# the decreasing part as empty. Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered
# Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.

# Examples:
# Input arr[] = {1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1};
# Output: 6 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 6 is 1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1)
#
# Input arr[] = {12, 11, 40, 5, 3, 1}
# Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 12, 11, 5, 3, 1)
#
# Input arr[] = {80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10}
# Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 80, 60, 30, 20, 10)


# Idea -> Similar to LIS problem
# We will create 2 lists
# lis -> Longest increasing Subsequence
# lds -> Longest Decreasing Subsequence
#
# and we will finally return lis[i] + lds[i] - 1

# Why -1? -> Because the end of teh lis array and teh beginning of teh lds array are counted twice
